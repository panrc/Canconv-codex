# For PyTorch, ensure your pip command or global pip config points to the correct index or use a specific install command
# Or add the torch line with its specific index if needed, e.g.:
# torch==2.3.1+cu121 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
# For now, assuming torch will be installed separately or a compatible version found by pip.
# Let's try with a version that pip might find more easily without a specific CUDA build string initially,
# or one that you confirm is in your configured pip index.
# Reverting to a common way to specify torch, pip will try to find a compatible version.
# If GPU is needed, this might download CPU-only. Best to install torch separately.  # Attempting a version that is likely in standard pypi, might be CPU. CUDA version needs specific index.
